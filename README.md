> Your agent's **actions** survive in git and shell history. Its **reasoning**
> does not — the transcript that held the "why" is compacted mid-session and
> auto-deleted after 30 days. Flight Recorder is the black box that keeps it.

**Flight Recorder** captures every consequential action your Claude Code agent
takes — shell commands, file edits, network calls, credential and account
operations — *at the moment it happens*, binds each action to the reasoning
that produced it, and preserves everything in a local, append-only, greppable
store with a live timeline. It pulls the reasoning out at hook time, before
compaction or deletion can destroy it. **The one-sentence demo:** ask *"why did
the agent add this environment variable?"* three weeks later, click the action,
and read the exact reasoning that produced it.

## Why

Ask yourself:

- Has an agent ever changed a config or created a resource you couldn't later explain?
- Do you run agents headless, in CI, or on cron — where nobody is watching?
- Have you lost the reasoning behind a change because the transcript compacted or expired?
- Do you need an audit trail of what an agent did — not just the chat log — for review or compliance?

**If yes to any of these, Flight Recorder is for you.** Agent actions have real
side effects, and the actions are often recoverable — but the *reasoning* lives
only in the transcript, which vanishes under context pressure and after 30
days. Everyone else records *what happened*; Flight Recorder durably records
*why*, and "why" is exactly what transcript deletion destroys.

> [!NOTE]
> **Best for:** developers running Claude Code locally, in CI, or on long
> headless jobs who want a durable, private record of what the agent did and
> why.
>
> **Not for:** cloud observability, blocking/policy enforcement (it records, it
> doesn't gate), or non–Claude Code agents (the event schema is agent-agnostic,
> but only the Claude Code hook adapter ships today).

## How Flight Recorder compares

| Tool | What it is | Why Flight Recorder is different |
|------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Post-hoc transcript summarizers | Distill an expired chat log into markdown | We capture at **action time** via hooks — nothing to lose to expiry |
| Cloud agent observability | Enterprise dashboards, OTel pipelines | **Local-first, zero-config** — your audit trail never leaves your disk |
| LLM call recorders | Record/replay calls for framework agents (LangChain, etc.) | We target **Claude Code natively** via hooks — no code changes |
| DIY hook loggers | Append tool names to a file | We capture **what + why + git state + risk**, with a live viewer |

## Install

**1 — the recorder + CLI** (Python 3.11+):

```
pip install -e .
```

**2 — build the viewer** (Node 18+):

```
cd viewer
npm install
npm run build
```

That produces `viewer/dist`, which `fr ui` serves. (For UI development, use
`npm run dev` instead — it runs on `:5173` and proxies `/api` to the backend.)

## Usage

```
cd your-project
fr init      # registers hooks in ./.claude/settings.json, creates the store
fr status    # hooks installed? events flowing? last event age
fr ui        # opens the live timeline at http://127.0.0.1:7878
fr grep rm   # grep across the plaintext JSONL mirror
```

Then just use Claude Code in that project. Actions stream into the timeline
live. `fr init --global` registers the hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`
instead, so every project is recorded.

## How it works

A single hook runs on every Claude Code lifecycle event, writes directly to
SQLite in WAL mode, and **exits 0 no matter what** — a recorder that can break
the pilot's controls is worse than no recorder. **There is no daemon:** the
hook is the only writer, the viewer is a pure reader, so "forgot to start the
service" can't cause silent data loss, and install is one command.

    end

    end

    STORE --> VIEWER["fr-viewer<br/>FastAPI · :7878"]
    VIEWER -->|"REST + live SSE"| SPA["React timeline + drawer"]
```

The reasoning window is read from the tail of the live transcript at hook time.
When the model didn't narrate a step, the event is stored with an honest
`capture_gap` flag rather than fabricated text — **we never invent a "why."**
The `PreCompact` hook snapshots the whole transcript before Claude Code
compacts it, so the reasoning survives even when the context doesn't.

## Risk tiers

Every action is auto-tagged by a deterministic, table-driven classifier — no
LLM in the hot path. Rules live in one editable [`risk_rules.yaml`](flight_recorder/risk_rules.yaml).

| Tier | Colour | Triggers |
|------|--------|----------|
| `info` | ⚪ gray | `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `LS` |
| `write` | 🔵 blue | `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit` |
| `exec` | 🟠 amber | `Bash` (default) |
| `network` | 🟣 purple | `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `curl`/`wget`/`ssh`/`scp` in a shell command |
| `sensitive` | 🔴 red | secrets/tokens, `rm -rf`, `sudo`, permissive `chmod`, `.env`, `DROP TABLE`, `git push --force`, account creation, keychain access |

Patterns are matched against a tool's **arguments and its result**, so a secret
that only appears in output still gets flagged. Search tools (`Grep`/`Glob`/
`WebSearch`) are exempt from argument matching — searching *for* the word
`sudo` isn't running it.

## The viewer

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/timeline.png" alt="Live timeline, newest at top, risk-colored rows" width="820"/>
<br/><br/>
<img src="docs/drawer-why.png" alt="Detail drawer, WHY tab: the captured reasoning behind an action" width="820"/>
</div>

One vertical stream, newest at top, risk colour as the primary channel. Every
row's first line of reasoning shows inline (`↳ why: …`); click any action for
the full drawer — **WHAT** (syntax-highlighted arguments), **WHY** (the
captured reasoning, verbatim), **CONTEXT** (git branch, HEAD, dirty flag), and
**RESULT** (output, exit status). Search takes qualifier chips —
`tool:bash risk:sensitive file:deploy session:brainstorm` — over a SQLite FTS5
index. Keyboard-native: `j`/`k` to move, `Enter` to open, `/` to search.

```

## Store layout

Everything lives under `~/.flight-recorder/`, all local, all yours:

```
recorder.db                 # SQLite, WAL mode, FTS5 search index
events/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl     # append-only plaintext mirror — cat / grep / jq it
snapshots/<session>/        # transcripts copied before compaction
debug/raw_payloads.jsonl    # every raw hook payload, for parser inspection
```

## Privacy

Zero remote servers, zero external auth, zero cloud tracking. The hook makes no
network calls, ever. The entire suite passes the airplane-mode test — your
audit trail never leaves your disk. This is a headline feature, not an
afterthought.

<div align="right"><kbd><a href="#top">↑ back to top ↑</a></kbd></div>

## Development

**Backend:**

```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest            # 60 gate tests, deterministic, < 1s
```

**Frontend:**

```
cd viewer
npm install
npm run dev                 # :5173, proxies /api to :7878
npm test                    # 42 tests (vitest)
npm run build               # produces viewer/dist, served by `fr ui`
```

To try changes end to end: `fr init` in any project, use Claude Code, and watch
`fr ui`. New contributions ship with tests in the same commit — see
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the working standard.

## Known limitations (honest, not hidden)

- **`capture_gap` is expected, not a bug.** Models often reason once and then
  chain several tool calls with no narration between them — those actions are
  recorded with no "why" because there genuinely wasn't one to capture.
- **Bash file extraction is best-effort**, not a real shell parser. It covers
  the common verbs (`rm`/`mv`/`cp`/`touch`/`mkdir`) and redirects; globs,
  subshells, and `find -exec` are silently missed rather than guessed at.
- **Risk classification is heuristic** — text patterns can't perfectly tell
  intent from mention.
- **The viewer is served from source** (`viewer/dist`), not packaged into the
  Python wheel yet.
- **History loads up to 5000 events** — a hard cap, not paginated.

## Roadmap

- **Incident report export** — select a time range → one markdown report of
  what happened, in order, with reasoning excerpts.
- **Multi-session view** — all recorded sessions in one list, cross-session search.
- **File-diff snapshots** — before/after content for edits, beyond what
  `tool_input` provides.
- **Sensitive-action desktop notification** — a ping the moment a
  `sensitive`-tier action fires.
- **Packaged viewer** — ship `viewer/dist` inside the wheel so `pip install` is
  the only step.
